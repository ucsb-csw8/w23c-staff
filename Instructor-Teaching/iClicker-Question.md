## Using iClicker Cloud

As part of the iClicker setup, you should have downloaded and installed the `iClicker Cloud` desktop app for your instructor computer.

To administer an iClicker question, you'll first open that app, and find your class:

That looks like this:

* You'll hover over your class, and theh a `Start Class` button pops up.
* Then you click `Start Class`
* Then after a delay, a small widget with a cloud pops up
* You may think you want the "quiz" option, but typically you don't; if you are just asking a single question at a time, and the questions that you want to ask are embedded 
  in your course materials (e.g. your slides, web page, etc.), then you want to select `poll`, not `quiz`.
* Selecting `poll` gives you a start button, a stop button, and the ability to show/hide the results.
* You can then click to "end class"

This animation illustrates all of these functions:

# When having students do iClicker for the first time

* You should have created a "Join iClicker" in Gauchospace as part of Setup.
* First, direct them to click that link to join the class.
* Then, you can start administering `poll` questions.

# Tell students about "recorded absences"

If/when instructors/TAs practice with iClicker, this may create "class meetings" where students don't join.

That may create messages that confuse students such as  "1 recorded absence" or "2 recorded absences".

To avoid this: be sure that if you do any practice sessions, you delete these promptly.

Here's what that looks like:
