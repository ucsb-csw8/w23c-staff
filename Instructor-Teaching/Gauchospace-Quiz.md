# General practices

Our practice has been to create the quiz in Gauchospace, using questions from a large question bank put together by Prof K, and extended somewhat by Prof. Matni.

We set up the quiz on Gauchospace to start five minutes after the start of class (e.g. 9:35 for a 9:30 class) and end at either 9:45 (10 minutes), 9:50 (15 minutes) or 9:55 (20 minutes).

We can set up extra time for DSP students in Gauchospace; more on that below.

The normal time is 15 minutes; we leave 20 minutes when students are expected to write code.

We typically give the quiz on the second class meeting of the week (e.g. Wednesday for a MW class, Thursday for a TR class.)

**Week 1 Practice Quiz**: The quiz in week 1 is just practice with quiz mechanics, and it's just a participation grade: all of the answer are given or obvious.

**Quizzes cover previous weeks material**: Starting with week 2, each week's quiz covered material from the zyBook chapter for the *previous* week.

The syllabus states that there will be 3-6 quizzes.  The intent is for the quizzes tend to drop off as we get closer to the project phase of the course (i.e. weeks, 7,8,9,10).


# Quiz Setup 

Typically, you have everything set up in advance:
* There is a link on Gauchospace to the quiz
* The start time and end time are set
* Exceptions for DSP students are entered

# Administering the quiz

Since most everything is set up in advance,  the only thing you need to do while actually administering the quiz is tell the students: 

* Please go to Gauchospace and be ready to start the quiz
* Mute instructor mic while taking the quiz
* Give a 2 minute warning before the quiz closes
* Optional: Offer a short break after quiz closes before starting lecture (Prof. Matni did this to help with transition, and to provide a buffer for the DSP students that get extra time.)
* Optional: You can disable DM's in chat (see below)

# Disabling DM's in chat

In the `Meeting Chat` window on Zoom, look at the place where you type in messages.

There's three dots next to the emoji icon. Click here, and you'll see options for enabling/disabling chat:
