for your course.  
2. Now select `Settings` in the left nav.
3. You should now have `Integrations` as a tab at the top; click on that
4. You should now see a page like this one.  Toggle to turn on the LTI integration:

6. Now go to Gauchospace and `Turn Editing On`

   Then, click to `+ Add a New Activity or Resource`
   
   Use the second tab that says `All`
   
   You should now see `External Tool` as an option. This is what you want.
