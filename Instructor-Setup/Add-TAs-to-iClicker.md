In the iClicker Cloud desktop application, you'll see three dots next to your course:

Click on those, and click "View Course Online".  
* This should bring up a web page where there are additional settings
for your course.  
* In the left navigation, there is an option called `People`.
* Then, there are tabs for `Students` and `Instructors`.  Select `Instructors`
* Now you can add additional instructors and/or TAs to your iClicker course.
 
(Note that the "Settings" option inside the iClicker Cloud app does *not* allow you to add additional
instructors or TAs.)

Here's what the process looks like:
